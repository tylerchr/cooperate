# cooperate [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/tylerchr/cooperate?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/tylerchr/cooperate)

Package cooperate is a library for implementing Operational Transformation.

This package was primarily written to teach myself about the mathematical underpinnings of Operational Transformation. No guarantees are made about the correctness, efficiency, or reliability of this implementation. :)

## Status

Really, only the most basic fundamentals exist right now: the `Compose` and `Transform` are implemented for text-based data.

I haven't gotten to work on any of the client-server interaction yet.
